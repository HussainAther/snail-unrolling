# 📸 Snail Shell Photo Submission Checklist

To contribute usable shell images for unrolling and pattern analysis, please follow the checklist below. These help ensure the images are consistent, well-aligned, and informative.

---

## ✅ Capture Guidelines

### 🌀 Orientation
- Shell apex (tip) should be clearly visible.
- Try to keep the aperture (opening) facing the same direction across angles.
- Align camera axis perpendicular to the spiral axis.

### 🔄 Coverage
- Capture 360° around the shell in ~1° to 2° increments.
- Ensure a full rotation without gaps.
- Photograph a narrow strip around the middle (equator-like region).

### 💡 Lighting
- Use diffused, even lighting to avoid harsh shadows and glare.
- Natural light works well; avoid flash if possible.
- White or neutral background preferred.

### 🎯 Focus & Distance
- Ensure the shell is fully in focus, especially the nearest strip.
- Use a tripod or fixed mount for consistent shots.
- Keep camera distance fixed across frames.

### 🩹 Injury Regions
- If analyzing regeneration or injury, capture close-ups before and after.
- Include date, notes, and any known time between injury and recovery.

## 💾 File Format
- Submit images as `.png` or `.jpg`
- Use filenames like: `specimen123_000.png`, `specimen123_001.png`, ...
