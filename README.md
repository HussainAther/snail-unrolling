## 🐌 Snail Unrolling – Computational Mosaicing & Pattern Analysis

Unroll the complex 3D spiral of a snail shell into a 2D map for analysis, pattern modeling, and biological insight. Inspired by discussions with Dick Gordon, this project investigates the mechanisms of shell growth, damage recovery, and pigmentation pattern formation.

### 🚀 Features
- 🌀 **Extract**: Narrow strip extraction from shell images
- 🧩 **Stitch**: Mosaicing of shell strips into a full panoramic view
- 🧭 **Axis Detection**: Identify spiral center and orientation
- 🗺 **Flatten**: Project spiral surface into a 2D plane (“Unrolling the Snail”)
- 🎨 **Simulate**: Generate synthetic shell patterns with Turing and Cellular Automata models
- 🩹 **Compare**: Analyze pre-/post-injury shell patterns for damage recovery and modeling validation
- ✅ **Command-Line Ready** with Makefile + CLI scripting

### 🧠 Why Turing & Cellular Automata?

Snail shell patterns aren’t random — they arise from dynamic biological processes:

- **Turing Patterns** (reaction-diffusion systems) simulate morphogen-based pigment regulation
- **Cellular Automata** simulate discrete rule-based development, reflecting genetic control systems

Both models allow us to test biological hypotheses — especially in **injury recovery**, where regenerated patterns may reveal deeper properties of developmental stability and error correction.

### 🩹 Shell Injury Recovery Hypothesis

Injured shells that regenerate offer a **natural experiment**:  
> Does the snail "replay" the same rules to rebuild its pattern?

By comparing pre- and post-injury segments, we can test whether **patterning logic is resilient**, disrupted, or adaptive — helping understand both normal growth and developmental plasticity.

Snail shell regeneration offers a way to test if pigment patterning rules persist through biological disruption. By comparing pre- and post-injury segments, we can analyze whether underlying mechanisms (e.g., Turing patterns) are stable, adaptive, or divergent after damage.
