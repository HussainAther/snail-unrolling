# 🐌 Snail Unrolling – Computational Mosaicing & Pattern Analysis

This project aims to digitally "unroll" 3D snail shells into 2D flat maps to analyze biological patterning and growth dynamics.

## 🧪 Core Concept
Snail shells grow in logarithmic spirals. By unwrapping the shell surface digitally, we can study pigment patterns, damage regeneration, and mathematical modeling in a flat, analyzable format.

## 📸 Pipeline
1. Capture narrow strip images around the shell
2. Take full 360° photos
3. Detect shell axis + geometry
4. Extract closest pixels to reduce distortion
5. Flatten to 2D via projection

## 🧠 Modeling
We’ll explore:
- Reaction-Diffusion systems (e.g., Turing)
- Cellular Automata (e.g., Wolfram’s rules)
- Fourier Analysis (pattern periodicity)

## 🛠️ Structure
- `src/` – modular code for projection, stitching, modeling
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter demos and experiments
- `data/` – raw and processed image sets

## 🚀 Status
🟢 Actively developing  
🧠 Seeking high-res images of snail shells  
💡 Open to collaboration
